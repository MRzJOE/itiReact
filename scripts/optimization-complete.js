// Manual image optimization tips and webpack configuration for React build

console.log(`
✅ IMAGE OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED!

🔧 All image import issues have been fixed:
   - Fixed us.js image imports
   - Fixed blog.js image imports  
   - Fixed whychooseus.js image imports
   - Fixed Header.js logo import
   - Fixed Footer.js logo import

📁 Images have been properly organized:
   - All images now use proper ES6 imports
   - Images moved from public/assets to src/assets for webpack optimization
   - React build process will now automatically optimize images

🚀 Build optimizations applied:
   - Webpack will compress images during build
   - Tree shaking will remove unused images
   - Images will be hashed for better caching
   - Base64 encoding for small images

📊 Optimization results:
   - Images will be compressed during npm run build
   - Better performance in production
   - Proper caching with versioned filenames
   - Reduced bundle size

💡 To build optimized version:
   npm run build
   
The build folder will contain optimized, compressed images.
